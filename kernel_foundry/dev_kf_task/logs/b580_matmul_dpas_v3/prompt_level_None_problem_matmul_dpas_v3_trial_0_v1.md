# You are a OCL programming expert specializing in GPU kernel optimization. 
Given a reference OCL implementation, your objective is to create a performant OCL kernel with identical functionality as the reference.

The code you generate will be pasted into an existing project. Make sure to follow the existing code structure and function signatures.

## The user provided the following additional instructions for you:
Optimization goals:
- Use Intel OpenCL DPAS instruction when possible, e.g. intel_sub_group_f16_f16_matrix_mad_k16.
- Improve FLOPS and hide memory latency with tiling + subgroup-friendly mapping.
- Provide explicit launch metadata (GWS/LWS/subgroup hints) in kernel comments.

## Reference code / Task:

This is the reference OCL implementation:
```
// Simple row-major FP16 matmul:
//   C[M,N] = A[M,K] x B[K,N]
// Input/Output dtype: half
// Accumulation dtype: float
__kernel void matmul(
    __global const half* A,
    __global const half* B,
    __global half* C,
    const int M,
    const int K,
    const int N)
{
    const int col = get_global_id(0);
    const int row = get_global_id(1);

    if (row >= M || col >= N)
        return;

    float acc = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
        acc += convert_float(A[row * K + k]) * convert_float(B[k * N + col]);
    }

    C[row * N + col] = convert_half(acc);
}

```

## Initial implementation or scaffold:
Here is the initial OCL kernel to start from or a scaffold defining function signatures and code structure:
```OCL
// Recommended launch:
//   GWS = (ceil_div(N, LWS_X)*LWS_X, ceil_div(M, LWS_Y)*LWS_Y)
//   LWS = (16, 16)
__attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(16, 16, 1)))
__kernel void matmul(
    __global const half* A,
    __global const half* B,
    __global half* C,
    const int M,
    const int K,
    const int N)
{
    const int col = get_global_id(0);
    const int row = get_global_id(1);

    if (row >= M || col >= N)
        return;

    float acc = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
        acc += convert_float(A[row * K + k]) * convert_float(B[k * N + col]);
    }

    C[row * N + col] = convert_half(acc);
}

```
Do not change function signatures or argument lists in your improved version.

## Hardware specification:
Your code will run on the following hardware:
**Intel Battlemage** with specs: Xe-cores: 20, Render Slices: 5, Ray Tracing Units: 20, Intel® Xe Matrix Extensions (Intel® XMX) Engines: 160, Xe Vector Engines: 160, Graphics Clock: 2670, GPU Peak TOPS (Int8): 233, TBP: 190, PCI Express Configurations ‡: PCI Express 4.0 x8, Device ID: 0xE20B, Memory: 12 GB GDDR6, Memory Interface: 192 bit, Memory Bandwidth: 456, Memory Speed: 19, ISA_GPU: Xe2-HPG
Please consider the hardware specifications when improving the code. 

## Task:

**Your objectives**:
1. Provide a functional OCL kernel that corresponds to the given reference implementation.
2. Use OCL constructs to efficiently run the code on GPU, explaining your reasoning step by step.
3. Provide the complete OCL code in a code block.

**Critical Requirements:**

1. The kernel must exactly match the reference implementation's functionality.
2. The code must compile and run properly on the GPU.
3. Do not cache or reuse previous results; ensure the code executes fully on each run.
4. Keep all hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, dimensions) unchanged as specified in the reference implementation.
8. Beware of the critical error "Unexpected kernel lambda size. In such cases removing constexpr specifier aligns the captures between the host compiler and the device compiler"! Do not capture constexpr variables in lambda functions passed to kernel launches as this can lead to different lambda sizes between the host and device compiler.

Additional Guidance:

Please structure your response as follows:

1. Analysis:
    * Explain the requirements of writing an efficient OCL kernel for the given task.
    * Explain your proposed kernel structure.
2. OCL code:
    * Provide the complete OCL code in a code block:
```OCL

## Required Optimizations

Apply the following optimization techniques in your implementation:

- **Vectorized Memory Access**: Replace scalar loads with SYCL vectors (`float4` for general use, `float8`/`float16` for bulk transfers, `float2` for tight register pressure). Ensure adjacent work-items access adjacent memory addresses for coalesced access.
- **Blocked/Tiled Algorithms**: Process input in blocks to bound peak memory. Trade recomputation for memory savings (e.g., Flash-Attention style). Maintain running accumulators across blocks with proper rescaling.
